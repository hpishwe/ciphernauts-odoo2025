## Problem statement 
- Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing
through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable
fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of
discarding them.
